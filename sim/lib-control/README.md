# Why this directory exists

There's no apparent simple way that I can find to adjust the include paths for the MATLAB S Function builder to allow having separate `src/` and `include/` directories. Having all the files (.c and .h) needed for the simulation (even as symlinks) seems to be the easiest solution.
